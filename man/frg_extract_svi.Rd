\item{erode}{flag if 1, then perfom analysis on eroded ROIS (default to 1)}

\item{Intermed_Dir}{string name of the Folder containing the intermediate processing results}

\item{Overlap}{string If == 'Single', extract time series for areas burned once.
if =='Multiple, extract time series for areas burned multiple times}

\item{Shape_File_Orig}{string Filename of the original input BAs shapefile}

\item{LUT_File_Multiple}{string Filenlame of the LUT table created by FRG_Process_Shapefile.py}

\description{
Function used to extract Scaled VIs time series of the different pixels of analyzed burnt areas,
associate info form the burnt areas shapefile and save as an RData file to be used for statistical analysis
}
\details{
This function is used to extract Scaled VIs time series of the different pixels of analyzed burnt
areas from the raster images created by 'FRG_Compute_SVI.R, associate ancillary info derived form the burnt
areas shapefile (e.g., Area, FireYear, ...) and save results as an RData file (in the '/TS_Extraction subfolder)
to be used later for statistical analysis
