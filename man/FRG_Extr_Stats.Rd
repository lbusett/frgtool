\description{
Function used to extract Scaled VIs time series of the different pixels of analyzed burnt areas, associate info form the burnt areas \cr
            shapefile and save as an RData file to be used for statistical analysis
}
\details{
This function is used to extract Scaled VIs time series of the different pixels of analyzed burnt areas from the raster images created by \cr
        "FRG_Compute_SVI.R, associate ancillary info derived form the burnt areas shapefile (e.g., Area, FireYear, ...) and save results as an RData file \cr
        (in the "/TS_Extraction subfolder) to be used later for statistical analysis
